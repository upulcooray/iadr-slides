Hello everyone!! My name is Upul Cooray. I am 3rd year PhD student in Tohoku University, Japan.
In this precentation i  will talk about how we examined the robustness of the association between oral health and general health using a machine learning prediction algorithm.

# INTRODUCTION

class: one

# INTRODUCTION
<hr>

* Conventionally, .green[Oral Health] and .green[General Health] are treated as 
separate entities within health care systems.
--

* This separation exist in training personals, allocating resources, delivery of primary health care...etc.
--

* However, the link between oral  health and general health has been studied for decades.
--

* Research related to oral health and general health associations fall into 4 main categories.

# INTRODUCTION
<hr>
.one[* Research related to oral health and general health associations fall into 4 main categories.]

--
1. oral manifestations of systemic diseases
--

1. biochemical links between oral infections and systemic diseases

???

Bio chemical links such as the association between periodontal disease and CVD

--

1. mediating effect of nutrition on the association between oral health and general health
--

1. common risk factors of oral and general health problems.

???

factors such as diet , socio-economic , demographic

Then lets look at the basic intuition behind the hypothesis of this study

# HYPOTHESIS
<hr>

???
As I mentioned earlier the association between oral health and general health can 
exist in  the form of common risk factors or as actual biochemical links.

# HYPOTHESIS
<hr>

???
However, I we just simple look at it we can observed that both the porr oral health and poor general general health
negatively affect overall welbeing of individuals

# HYPOTHESIS
<hr>

???
in addition to that we can imagine oral health affecting the general health via pathways like nutrition, psycisocial social factors 

and the general health can infulence the oral health via things like if you are generally ill wou find it difficult to maintain oral hygine 
and then get oral problems or people might experience advers effects of medications for their general conditions in the oral cavity

## "Prediction model"

# Methods
<hr>


__Data source:__ Japanese Gerontological Evaluation Study 2016 (JAGES)

???
JAges is nationwide epidemiological survey for community dwelling older adults age 65 years or older 

--

__Number of participants:__ 19,862 participants aged 65 years or older

--


.pull-left[.content-box-yellow[.purple[Outcome 1: self-rated poor oral health]
__Predictors set 1:__
- frailty
- psychological status
- comorbidity
- .grey[age/ sex/ income/ smoking]]]


--

.pull-right[.content-box-yellow[.purple[Outcome 2: self-rated poor general health]
__Predictors set 2:__
- poor occlusion
- chewing difficulty
- dry mouth
- .grey[age/ sex/ income/ smoking]]]


---

# Methods
<hr>


__Prediction algorithm:__ Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classification .pl7[algorithm] 

???
we used xgboost as it is well-known for its high efficincy and accuracy

--

__Model evaluation:__ Ten fold cross-validation

--

__Evaluation matrices:__ Accuracy/ C-statistics (AUC)

???

We evaluated the models using accuracy and auc score

--

__Model explanations:__ Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) values

???
In addition we used shaply additive explanation values which is well-known framework for explainable machine learning.
we used values to investigate how each predictor behaved in predicting their respective outcome

- __47.7%__ of the people with poor general health also reported poor oral health

here is the summary of SHAP analsis for perdicting general health using oral health predictors
we observed that lower household income, older age , and having chewing difficulty as the 
most important predictors in predicting poor general health

This figure shows the summary of SHAP analsis for perdicting poor oral health using general health predictors
here we observed that higher frailty scores, younger age , lower household income, and depression as the 
most important predictors in predicting poor oral health

# Conclusions
<hr>
<br>

.center[Accurate predictions on oral health to general health and vice-versa association  indicate a existence of a .purple[__robust association__] between Oral Health and General Health. Therefore, __oral health and general health should be considered collectively__ when planning health care for older adults.

Furthermore, SHAP analysis indicated the importance of socio-economic factors such as __household income__ in predicting both oral health and general health indicating the importance of tackling __social determinants__ to improve overall well-being.]
