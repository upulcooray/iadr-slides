Hello everyone!! My name is Upul Cooray. I am 3rd year PhD student in Tohoku University, Japan.
Here I will present how we examined the robustness of the association between oral health and general health using machine learning prediction algorithms.

# INTRODUCTION
<hr>

* Conventionally, .green[Oral Health] and .green[General Health] are treated as 
separate entities within health care systems.
--

* This separation exist in training personals, allocating resources, delivery of primary health care...etc.
--

* However, the link between oral  health and general health has been studied for decades.
--

* Research related to oral health and general health associations fall into 4 main categories.

.one[* Research related to oral health and general health associations fall into 4 main categories.]

--
1. Related to oral manifestations of systemic disease
--

1. Related to-chemical links between oral infections and systemic diseases
--

1. Related to mediating effect of nutrition on the association between oral health and general health
--

1. Related to common risk factors of oral and general health problems.
