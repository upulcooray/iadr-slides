Hello everyone!! My name is Upul Cooray. I am 3rd year PhD student in Tohoku University, Japan.
Here In this  will present how we examined the robustness of the association between oral health and general health using machine learning prediction algorithms.

# INTRODUCTION

class: one

# INTRODUCTION
<hr>

* Conventionally, .green[Oral Health] and .green[General Health] are treated as 
separate entities within health care systems.
--

* This separation exist in training personals, allocating resources, delivery of primary health care...etc.
--

* However, the link between oral  health and general health has been studied for decades.
--

* Research related to oral health and general health associations fall into 4 main categories.

# INTRODUCTION
<hr>
.one[* Research related to oral health and general health associations fall into 4 main categories.]

--
1. Related to oral manifestations of systemic disease
--

1. Related to biochemical links between oral infections and systemic diseases
--

1. Related to mediating effect of nutrition on the association between oral health and general health
--

1. Related to common risk factors of oral and general health problems.

## "Intuition"

Then lets look at the basic intuition behind the hypothesis of this study

# HYPOTHESIS
<hr>

???
As I mentioned earlier the association between oral health and general health can 
exist in  the form of common risk factors or as actual biochemical links.

# HYPOTHESIS
<hr>

???
However, I we just simple look at it we can observed that both the porr oral health and poor general general health
negatively affect overall welbeing of individuals

# HYPOTHESIS
<hr>

???
in addition to that we can imagine oral health affecting the general health via pathways like nutrition, psycisocial social factors 

and the general health can infulence the oral health via things like if you are generally ill wou find it difficult to maintain oral hygine 
and then get oral problems or people might experience advers effects of medications for their general conditions in the oral cavity

.pull-right[.content-box-yellow[.purple[Outcome 2: self-rated poor general health]
__Predictors set 2:__
- poor occlusion
- chewing difficulty

- __47.7%__ of the people with poor general health also reported poor oral health
